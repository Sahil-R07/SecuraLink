# SecuraLink

## Overview

This project demonstrates a simple VPN system implemented in Python. It includes a client and server that communicate securely using AES encryption. The server listens for incoming messages from the client, decrypts them, and sends back an encrypted response. This example serves as an educational tool to understand basic VPN concepts and secure data transmission.

## Features

- **AES Encryption**: Utilizes AES encryption in CBC mode to secure messages.
- **Client-Server Model**: Demonstrates a basic client-server interaction with encrypted communication.
- **Educational Tool**: Ideal for learning about encryption, networking, and VPN fundamentals.
